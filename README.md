# RecursionError in Python: Exceeding Maximum Recursion Depth

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`. It occurs when a recursive function calls itself too many times, exceeding Python's default recursion limit.  This example uses a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers. While this works for small inputs, larger inputs trigger the error.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` shows the corrected code with iterative approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers for larger inputs efficiently.
